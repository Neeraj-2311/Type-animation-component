# Custom Typing Animation Component

This repository contains a custom typing animation component built using React. The component simulates a typewriter-like text animation, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect for your web applications.

## How to Use

To integrate the custom typing animation into your React app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or Download Repository:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Neeraj-2311/Type-animation-component.git

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Navigate to the Component Folder:
Move to the `src` folder of the repository:

cd Type-animation-component/src

3. Import and Use in `App.js`:
Open your `App.js` file (or any other component where you want to use the animation). Import the `Example` component from the cloned repository:
```jsx
  import { Example } from "./Example"; // Path to the Example component
```

1. Include the Component in JSX:
Within your component's JSX, place the <Example /> component to render the custom typing animation:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Other content */}
      <Example />
    </div>
  );
}
```
2. Run the Application:
Start your React application to see the custom typing animation in action:

```jsx
  npm start
```
How It Works
The custom typing animation component utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks to create a typewriter-like effect. Here's an overview of how the animation works:

The Example component contains state variables to manage the animation, including loopNum, isDeleting, text, delta, and index.

An array toRotate holds the text strings to be displayed in the animation.

The useEffect hook triggers the animation by executing the tick function at intervals defined by the delta state.

The tick function updates the text state based on the animation progress, simulating the typing and deleting effect.

As the animation progresses, the delta state is adjusted to control the typing speed and delay between animations.

The animation loops through the toRotate array, simulating typing and deleting each text string.

The ```<h2>``` element displays the animated text with a dynamic cursor effect created using a div element.

Give it a Try!
Feel free to integrate the custom typing animation component into your React applications to add an engaging and dynamic element to your user interfaces. Be sure to explore the code and customize it further to suit your project's needs.

Enjoy experimenting and enhancing your user experience with this custom typing animation!
